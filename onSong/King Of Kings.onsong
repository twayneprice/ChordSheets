Intro:
[D][M]

Verse 1:
In the d[D..]arkness we were w[G..]aiting
Without ho[A..]pe without li[D..]ght
Till from h[D..]eaven You came r[G..]unning
There was m[A..]ercy in Your [D..]eyes
 
To fu[D..]lfill the law and p[G..]rophets 
To a v[A..]irgin came the W[D..]ord
From a th[D..]rone of endless gl[G..]ory
To a cr[A..]adle in the [D][     M]dirt
 
Chorus:
[D]Praise the Father
[G]Praise the Son
[Bm]Praise the Spirit [D..]Three in   One[A..]
[D]God of glory, [G]Majesty
[Bm..]Praise for[G..]ever to the [A..]King of [D][     M]Kings
 
Verse 2:
To re[D..]veal the kingdom [G..]coming
And to r[A..]econcile the [D..]lost
To re[D..]deem the whole cre[G..]ation
You did [A..]not despise the cr[D..]oss
 
For [D..]even in Your s[G..]uffering
You saw [A..]to the other s[D..]ide
Knowing [D..]this was our sal[G..]vation 
Jesus [A..]for our sake You [D][     M]died

Verse 3:
And the [Bm..]morning that You [G..]rose
All of h[A..]eaven held its br[D..]eath
Till that s[Bm..]tone was moved for g[G..]ood
For the L[A..]amb had conquered d[D..]eath
 
And the d[Bm..]ead rose from their t[G..]ombs
And the [A..]angels stood in [D..]awe
For the [Bm..]souls of all who'd [G..]come
To the [A..]Father are rest[D..]ored
 
Verse 4:
And the [D..]Church of Christ was b[G..]orn
Then the S[A..]pirit lit the fl[D..]ame
Now this [D..]gospel truth of [G..]old
Shall not [A..]kneel shall not f[D..]aint
 
By His [D..]blood and in His [G..]Name
In His fr[A..]eedom I am f[D..]ree
For the l[D..]ove of Jesus Ch[G..]rist
Who has re[A..]surrected [D][     M]me

Chorus 2:
[D]Praise the Father
[G]Praise the Son
[Bm]Praise the Spirit [D..]Three in   One[A..]
[D]God of glory, [G]Majesty
[Bm..]Praise for[G..]ever to the [A..]King of [D..]Kings

Outro:
[D..]Praise for[G..]ever to the [A..]King of [D][     M]Kings
